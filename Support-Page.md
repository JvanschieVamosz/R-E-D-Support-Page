## Enountered Issues
- 'Unable to generate content at this time' message.
This occurs when you have exhausted the API requests to Groq; give it 5-10 minutes, and the app should be usable again. Or, you can subscribe to become a premium member with greater token limits.

- No outputs available when not connected to the WiFi.
This means you have exhausted the fallback outputs created for when the user is not connected to WiFi and unable to make API requests. Fallback outputs are updated regularly. In this case, please connect to WiFi.
