## Enountered Issues
- No outputs available message
This occurs when you have exhausted the API requests to Groq; give it 5-10 minutes, and the app should be usable again

- No outputs available when not connected to the WiFi
This means you have exhausted the fallback outputs created for when the user is not connected to WiFi and unable to make API requests. Fallback outputs are updated regularly. In this case, please connect to WiFi.
